Please note that this is very much alpha code.
Please note that I know there is inceficient documenation.
please note that the segments code will undergo a servere rewrite after I get the transliterration code fixed.

Unicode::Regex::Parse is propably useable and uses Parse::RecDescent and Unicode::Regex::Set under the hood. If someone could remove the dependency on Unicode::Regex::Set I would be delighted. At that point I will concider the code sutable for CPAN

The general overview of the project it to convert the XML of the CLDR into a arge number of small Perl modules that can be loaded from the main Local::CLDR when needed to do what ever is required.

BUGS: 
Unicode property ccc is borked so I have intruduced a fixup in Unicode::Regex::Parser which changes \p{ccc=\d+} to \p{ccc\d+} if you then use Unicode::Regggex::CCC you will get the correct results
